# Hummingbot x Cube ğŸ§Š

We recommend installing Hummingbot using Docker if you want the simplest, easiest installation method and don't need to modify the Hummingbot codebase.

Installation Process

### 1. Install Docker Compose
   
Hummingbot uses [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.

The recommended way to get Docker Compose is to install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/), which includes Docker Compose along with Docker Engine and Docker CLI which are Compose prerequisites.

After installing Docker Desktop, verify that Docker Compose is installed correctly by checking the version:
```
docker compose version
```
The output should be: ```Docker Compose version v2.17.2``` or similar.

### 2. Clone Repo

Enter the following commands in Bash/Terminal to clone the Hummingbot Github repo and enter the root folder:
```
git clone https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot.git
cd hummingbot
```
### 3. Pull Image

The ```docker-compose.yml``` file in the root folder provides a basic configuration for launching an instance.

You will be able to modify this file and uncomment lines in order to automatically enter your pasword and start strategies. For now, we can use it as-is.

Run the following command to pull the image and start the instance:
```
docker compose up -d
```
After the images have been downloaded, you should see the following output:
```
[+] Running 1/1
 â ¿ Container hummingbot  Started
```

### 4. Attach to Instance

The``` -d``` flag runs Hummingbot in detached mode. Attach to it by running the command:
```
docker attach hummingbot
```

You should now see the Hummingbot welcome screen:
